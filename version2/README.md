Version2:
- It is based off version1.
- It seeks to reduce the number of constants used in the code so that a lot of parts can be re-used.
- This was done by re-evaluating all the calculations needed to get the final lot-size and the risk.
- This aided in the creation of version4. (It was the base on which version4 uses its formulas).


Version1:
- The template of the basics of the risk calculator.
- It shows which variables to think about and what we are trying to accomplish.
- V501s instrument is used as a base for test.

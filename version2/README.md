Version2 is based off version1.
It seeks to reduce the number of constants used in the code so that a lot of parts can be used.
This was done by re-evaluating all the calculations needed to get the final lot-size and the risk.
This aided in the creation of version4. (It was the base on which version4 uses its formulas).
